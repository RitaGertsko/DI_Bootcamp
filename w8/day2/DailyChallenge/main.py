# Daily Challenge: Old MacDonald’s Farm
# Create the code that is needed to recreate the code provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:
# 1. Create a class called Farm. How should this be implemented?
# 2. Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
# 3. How many methods does the Farm class need?
# 4. Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?
# 5. Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
# 6. Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.

# Expand The Farm
# 1. Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class. This method should return a sorted list of all the animal types (names) in the farm. With the example above, the list should be: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep'].
# 2. Add another method to the Farm class called get_short_info.
# This method should return the following string: “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheep.”. The method should call the get_animal_types function to get a list of the animals.

class Farm:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.farm_dic = {}
        self.info = f"{self.name}'s Farm\n"

    def add_animal(self, animal, amount=1):
        try:
            self.farm_dic[animal] = self.farm_dic[animal] + amount
        except KeyError:
            self.farm_dic[animal] = amount

    def get_info(self):
        self.info += "\n".join(key+": " + str(value) for key, value in self.farm_dic.items())
        self.info += "\nE-I-E-I-0!"
        return self.info

    def get_animal_types(self):
        return sorted(list(self.farm_dic.keys()))

    def get_short_info(self):
        animal_list = self.get_animal_types()
        return f"{self.name}'s farm has {','.join(animal_list[0:-2])} and {animal_list[-1]}"


macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
macdonald.add_animal('cow', 5)
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
print(macdonald.get_info())
print(macdonald.get_short_info())
